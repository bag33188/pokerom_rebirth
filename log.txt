PokeROM True Rebirth Log:

6:32 AM 6/5/2022

It's been a couple years since my last breakthrough on pokerom. I remember it fondly, I felt good, I look up upon those times (summer, 2019, ecuador, etc) even though I was somewhat struggling.

Thus, I think I can do the same this summer.

I am going to make a true rebirth of pokerom, but in laravel.

tbh this is going to be hard. im not even sure if i still got it.

let's just see what happens
